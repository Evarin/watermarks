# Watermark recognition training

## Data preparation

The data is not included in this repository. The best is to use directly the [data from the original project](http://imagine.enpc.fr/~shenx/data/Watermark.zip), which contains ready-to-use images in the `A_classification` folder. In this case, you can directly go to the next step.

If you want to use custom data: customize and run the `make_dataset.py` script to create the dataset from the annotations. See the script for more information.

## Training

Run the `train.py` script to train the model.
